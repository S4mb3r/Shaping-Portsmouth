      <p>The Shaping Portsmouth Charity Support Scheme is a programme designed to link tradesmen who would like to
        volunteer with our charities and trusts. As a volunteer we are asking you to donate your time and niche skills
        to help give back to the community. Skills such as programming, building, plumbing and much more will help those
        charities who require more support in these tough times. 
      </p>
      <p>
        This scheme promises to be an incredibly rewarding and
        fulfilling experience in which your help would be more than greatly appreciated. Thank you for your support, the
        link to register is below.
